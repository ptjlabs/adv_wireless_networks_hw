# Macro Cell Resource Allocation

5G is here, and the demand for higher data rates are inccreasing. To make sure that users are having a great Quality of Service (Q.O.E). A bidding system between the user's cell phone and Macro Cell Tower must take place to allocation the right amount resource to each individual user. In this project, Consider a mobile system consisting of a single base station and M mobile stations. The rate/resource allocated by the base station to i'th mobile station is given by ri. Each mobile station has its own utility function Ui(ri) that corresponds to the type of traffic being handled by it. The objective is to determine the rate the base station should allocate to the different mobile stations to achieve optimality.
